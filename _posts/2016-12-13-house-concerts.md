**Core Memory**, a non-profit arts and technology venture, is preparing to host a new series of house concerts in southern Rhode Island. The concerts will take place in a private home a few miles west of the coastal town of Narragansett. The home is nestled on a wooded hillside near a scenic mill pond, ideal for entertainment and relaxation.

The target audience for these concerts is music lovers who appreciate live performances in an informal setting. The size of the audience for each concert is yet to be determined, but we think the performance space will accomodate around 25 people. The suggested donation for each concert is $60 per person. We will contribute 1/3 of each donation to the [Kingston Chamber Music Festival](http://www.kingstonchambermusic.org).

Other than this blog, the only publicity for these concerts will be word of mouth and private communications. Please help spread the word!
