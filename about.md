Hi, I'm Craig Maynard. I moved to New England about a year ago, after living and working for many years in California and Colorado. I created this blog to write about my various projects and activities. Currently, I'm spending most of my time managing the design and construction of a [custom home](/2016/08/05/this-new-house.html) in southern Rhode Island.

I'm also the chief cook and bottle washer for **Core Memory**, a non-profit venture that provides a business context for these activities:

* Organizing [house concerts](/2016/12/13/house-concerts.html) to showcase emerging professional artists.
* Contributing to the [Swift language project](https://swift.org) and the Swift package ecosystem.
* Using Swift to develop open-source software for [scientific research](http://researchkit.org).

If you have a comment or question, or you just want to say hello, please send me an [email](mailto:chmaynard@gmail.com) and I'll get back to you soon. Thanks! ðŸ¤“
